# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.
## Step 1: Install dependencies

To install ```node_modules```, run the following command from the root of the cloned project:

```sh
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro** dev server.

Run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
npm start
```

## Step 3: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of the React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run an Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
npm run android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies.

```sh
pod install
```

Then run

```sh

```
